<div class="caption"><p><a target="_blank" href="/blog/re-tracking-the-lincolnshire-poacher.html">Re-Tracking the Lincolnshire Poacher</a></p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/">BBC Radio</a> did a great little special called <a target="_blank" href="http://speechification.com/2008/08/23/lincolnshire-poacher-again"><em>Tracking the Lincolnshire Poacher</em></a>. We first discovered it on <a target="_blank" href="http://speechification.com">Speechification.com</a>, from a post by <a target="_blank" href="http://bowblog.com/">Stephen Bowbrick</a>. In it you will hear an account from a man who has met women who remember reading <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_stations">Numbers Stations</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conet_Project">Akin Fernandez</a> will discover a Numbers Station he had never heard before. With the Lincolnshire Poacher now off the air, it&rsquo;s perhaps even more worth your time to listen, too.</p>
<p>The Lincolnshire Poacher was a Numbers Station broadcasting from June 1989 until June of 2008. (This information comes from Jochen Sch&auml;fer, the &ldquo;Kopf&rdquo; of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cvni.net/radio/e2k/">ENIGMA2000</a> German Branch, E2Kde. Thanks Jochen!) Its name was copied from the <a title="Listen to the Lincolnshire Poacher" target="_blank" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Benjamin+Britten/_/The+Lincolnshire+Poacher">British folk tune</a> that plays at the beginning of each of its broadcasts. Many other Numbers Stations begin with a melody&mdash;<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Alfv%C3%A9n#Swedish_Rhapsody_.231_.28Midsommarvaka.29">The Swedish Rhapsody</a>, for example. These melodies are popularly believed to be some sort of queue for the agent in the field to ready themselves to take down the message.</p>
<p>Most of the tunes are nationalistic, which raises an interesting question: Why is it important that a government choose a nationalistic tune? It seems like this would not be important if all that was needed by a government was to send a communication to an agent, while not revealing the agent&rsquo;s nationality. So then, could it be that the tune is a decoy for an alias country? But broadcast locations are easily detected, compromising the decoy. So why, when a Numbers Station broadcasts for 19 years or more, would it be of any significance what melody acts as prelude? It could have been a completely random choice or a favorite tune of the operator, but let&rsquo;s be more suspicious.</p>
<p>We know that anyone, anywhere, can pick up a broadcasting Numbers Station with an over-the-counter shortwave radio. And, we know that shortwave radio signals travel halfway across the globe, allowing a listener to pick up signals from many different countries. Therefore it seems safe to wonder if the choice of melody is somehow related to the knowledge of a broad listening public, a show of force to a enemy, a comfort to its allies, or simply a nag.</p>
<p>Here you have a broadcast blaring the proud tunes of your enemy, unregistered on the dial but received within your borders, and it&rsquo;s accompanied by secret codes. You know that if you can hear it, most everyone in your country can. So, what is the message saying? Who is picking it up? Which of your loyal citizens sneaks a listen? Maybe the broadcasts are like a fly buzzing in the room; an invader that you can hear but can not see; you know what it is but you feel helpless to do anything about it. Maybe it&rsquo;s like the feeling of disappearing livestock. Frustration is a military tactic.</p>

<div id='synopsis'>
<p>Governments around the world broadcast encrypted messages via shortwave radio to secret agents in enemy territory. These publicly accessible yet indecipherable messages provide the framework for two stories, intertwining fact with fiction.</p>
<p>Clandestine documents the history of the spies caught possessing these coded messages. Juxtaposed with the stories of their capture is the fictional tale of a manâ€™s relationship with his father, a shortwave hobbyist, and his legacy of familial secrets.</p>
<p>Using freely available archive material, the film seamlessly re-contextualizes ephemeral cinema into a story of espionage and adultery, communication and miscommunication, and the relativity of good and bad.</p>
