<h2>Locally produced spy documentary showing Saturday</h2>

â€œOur nationâ€™s enemies, working in our midst, must use codes.â€
So says an unidentified American military official, seen through scratchy archival footage as he demonstrates the tools and techniques of the espionage trade.
The scene is from the short film â€œClandestine,â€ which premieres Saturday evening at the Mobile libraryâ€™s main branch.

<h2>Local Documentary No Longer â€œClandestineâ€</h2>

Managing to be both illuminating and disorienting at the same time, â€œClandestineâ€ is a rare and effective mix of authentic archival material and imagined narrative elements, creating a truly unique viewing experience.

<h2>10 Questions with Gideon & Marcus (with Code!)</h2>

In the early days of film the norm was to store a print for a few years after an initial run and when space was needed, to burn it. ... Unfortunately, it wasn't until the 1960s that film preservation really started in earnest and it really wasn't till the 1980s there were enough techniques developed to salvage the large number films that were literally crumbling...
<br />
<br />
What directors Kennedy and Rosentrater have done is to go beyond preservation and have,  in the tradition of oral storytelling, reordered the familiar to craft a new narrative that's grounded in reality, tinged in paranoia and intimately personal.

[Clandestine] is a 30 minute film and I found it to be fascinating and well told.  I like when documentaries teach us something, and this doc was quite interesting.

<h2>Mar 3: Cinequest, further down the rabbit hole.</h2>

<div class='description'>
Clandestine by Gideon Kennedy and Marcus Rosentrater is a fascinating Jay Rosenblatt-style trip down memory lane with help from the Prelinger and other archives. The mystery of sinister â€œnumber talkersâ€ is used to contrast the secrets of the narratorâ€™s father: he was another one of those 1950s men much better at dealing with a ham radio than with people in the room. Still: â€œMy father was not, as they say, a member of the second oldest professionâ€â€”that is, a spy.

Based on previews, we expected a technically and intellectually riveting film.  It was â€“ and by the overused â€œrivetingâ€ we mean it will capture your attention completely. As Cinequest describes it: "Clandestine (is) a virtuosic mini-masterpiece about family and identity."

There is a special place for those pieces of film we love but sometimes have to leave behind. The IDFA has created a place to publish these "darlings" where the filmmakers can talk briefly about why they loved it, and why it was removed. Here is the segment Gideon Kennedy & Marcus Rosentrater left behind.
