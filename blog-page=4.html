<p>A call for &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090605/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/us_us_cuba_spy_charges">comprehensive damage assessment</a>&rdquo; came from Secretary of State <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> after the arrest of Walter Kendall Myers and his wife Gwendolyn Steingraber Myers yesterday, June 5&nbsp;2009. The couple is officially accused of spying for the Cuban government for up to 30 years. Reports are indicating that Shortwave radios were used by the couple to receive encrypted messages from Cuba via <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_stations">Numbers Stations</a> broadcasts. 8 years earlier <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana_Montes">Ana Belen Montes</a> was also arrested for spying for the Cuban government, evidence in her case included a Shortwave radio and one-time pads on her laptop.<br/><br/>This is good news for <a target="_self" href="index.html">Clandestine</a> as it provides further evidence that these mysterious broadcasts are used by governments to communicate to spies in the field.</p>

Defense Imagery claims to have all their images and media from 1982 and forward available and searchable online. It&rsquo;s a great place to star looking as most government images fall under the <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.clandestine-movie.com/post/62354540/public-domain-resources">public domain</a>.<br/><br/>Knowing that while <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon">Pentagon</a> is the Department of Defense headquarters, the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Intelligence_Analysis_Center">Defense Intelligence Analysis Center</a> (DIAC) is where a lot of the heavy lifting occurs. One such heavy lifter is <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana_Montes">Ana Belen Montes</a>. We were able to locate her affidavit which provided the address and room number for her office which is located in the DIAC <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bolling_AFB_DC_-_5_Apr_1988.jpg">across the Potomac</a> from the Pentagon.<br/><br/>While <a target="_blank" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/">wikimedia.org</a> had some images of the DIAC, they were all taken before the re-construction process in 2003-2005, and Ana Montes was arrested in 2001.

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/">BBC Radio</a> did a great little special called <a target="_blank" href="http://speechification.com/2008/08/23/lincolnshire-poacher-again"><em>Tracking the Lincolnshire Poacher</em></a>. We first discovered it on <a target="_blank" href="http://speechification.com">Speechification.com</a>, from a post by <a target="_blank" href="http://bowblog.com/">Stephen Bowbrick</a>. In it you will hear an account from a man who has met women who remember reading <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_stations">Numbers Stations</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conet_Project">Akin Fernandez</a> will discover a Numbers Station he had never heard before. With the Lincolnshire Poacher now off the air, it&rsquo;s perhaps even more worth your time to listen, too.</p>
<p>The Lincolnshire Poacher was a Numbers Station broadcasting from June 1989 until June of 2008. (This information comes from Jochen Sch&auml;fer, the &ldquo;Kopf&rdquo; of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cvni.net/radio/e2k/">ENIGMA2000</a> German Branch, E2Kde. Thanks Jochen!) Its name was copied from the <a title="Listen to the Lincolnshire Poacher" target="_blank" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Benjamin+Britten/_/The+Lincolnshire+Poacher">British folk tune</a> that plays at the beginning of each of its broadcasts. Many other Numbers Stations begin with a melody&mdash;<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Alfv%C3%A9n#Swedish_Rhapsody_.231_.28Midsommarvaka.29">The Swedish Rhapsody</a>, for example. These melodies are popularly believed to be some sort of queue for the agent in the field to ready themselves to take down the message.</p>
<p>Most of the tunes are nationalistic, which raises an interesting question: Why is it important that a government choose a nationalistic tune? It seems like this would not be important if all that was needed by a government was to send a communication to an agent, while not revealing the agent&rsquo;s nationality. So then, could it be that the tune is a decoy for an alias country? But broadcast locations are easily detected, compromising the decoy. So why, when a Numbers Station broadcasts for 19 years or more, would it be of any significance what melody acts as prelude? It could have been a completely random choice or a favorite tune of the operator, but let&rsquo;s be more suspicious.</p>
<p>We know that anyone, anywhere, can pick up a broadcasting Numbers Station with an over-the-counter shortwave radio. And, we know that shortwave radio signals travel halfway across the globe, allowing a listener to pick up signals from many different countries. Therefore it seems safe to wonder if the choice of melody is somehow related to the knowledge of a broad listening public, a show of force to a enemy, a comfort to its allies, or simply a nag.</p>
<p>Here you have a broadcast blaring the proud tunes of your enemy, unregistered on the dial but received within your borders, and it&rsquo;s accompanied by secret codes. You know that if you can hear it, most everyone in your country can. So, what is the message saying? Who is picking it up? Which of your loyal citizens sneaks a listen? Maybe the broadcasts are like a fly buzzing in the room; an invader that you can hear but can not see; you know what it is but you feel helpless to do anything about it. Maybe it&rsquo;s like the feeling of disappearing livestock. Frustration is a military tactic.</p>
<p><strong>The Lincolnshire Poacher</strong></p>
<p>When I was bound apprentice in famous Lincolnshire<br/>Full well I served my master for nigh on seven years<br/>Till I took up to poaching as you shall quickly hear<br/>Oh, &lsquo;tis my delight on a shiny night in the season of the year.<br/><br/>As me and my companions was setting out a snare<br/>&lsquo;Twas then we spied the gamekeeper, for him we didn&rsquo;t care<br/>For we can wrestle and fight, my boys, and jump from anywhere<br/>Oh, &lsquo;tis my delight on a shiny night in the season of the year.<br/><br/>As me and my companions was setting four or five<br/>And taking them all up again, we caught a hare alive<br/>We caught a hare alive, my boys, and through the woods did steer<br/>Oh, &lsquo;tis my delight on a shiny night in the season of the year.<br/><br/>We threw him over my shoulder, boys, and then we trudged home<br/>We took him to a neighbour&rsquo;s house and sold him for a crown<br/>We sold him for a crown, my boys, but I divven&rsquo;t tell you where<br/>Oh, &lsquo;tis my delight on a shiny night in the season of the year.<br/><br/>Success to every gentleman that lives in Lincolnshire<br/>(Alt. Bad luck to every magistrate)<br/>Success to every poacher that wants to sell a hare<br/>Bad luck to every gamekeeper that will not sell his deer<br/>Oh, &lsquo;tis my delight on a shiny night in the season of the year.</p></div>

<h2><a href="blog/spy-chatter-listen-to-live-numbers-stations.html">Spy Chatter: Listen to Live Numbers Stations</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://spynumbers.com/" target="_blank">visit link &raquo;</a></p><p>After joining the <a title="Get reports on active numbers stations" target="_blank" href="http://mailman.qth.net/mailman/listinfo/spooks">Spy Numbers Stations mailing list</a>, we started receiving a couple of emails a day with the subject &ldquo;Automated Spy Numbers Loggings&rdquo; from the Spy Numbers Robot. The email is generated by a database observer associated with the Spy Numbers Stations database. When a radio operator discovers a <a title="Numbers Stations" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_stations">Numbers Station</a> broadcast, they can report the discovery to the database. Then Spy Numbers Robot emails everyone on the list that a new broadcast has been found and logged. The Spy Numbers Robot reports frequency, ENIGMA ID (the name for the broadcaster), day of the week, date, time (in UTC), mode (radio band), additional comments, and the name of the person who reported it and their location.</p>
<p>Here is a sample: (<a title="Logging Sample" target="_blank" href="http://gist.github.com/raw/75383/267e0bf297382a3324c5b3e102b8dbdd5717bc6a/Numbers%20Stations%20loggings">click here</a> if sample does not appear below)</p>
<p>
<script></script></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the second listing.</p>
<p>So we see that someone logged station M8a on March 6th, 2009 at 7:00am Greenwich Mean Time on frequency 5883 on the CW band. If you look at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spynumbers.com/profiles/enigma.html">ENIGMA ID reference list</a> you&rsquo;ll find that <a title="M8a profile" href="http://www.spynumbers.com/profiles/index.html?ENIGMA=M8" target="_blank">M8a</a> is a Cuban station that broadcasts three or so times a week with Morse Code blasts. This broadcast was reported by an amateur radio operator from Paris, TN, USA.</p>
<p>Spy Numbers can then analyze the history of data to provide information on current and future broadcasts. You can find predictions on what may be <a title="What&apos;s in the air?" href="http://www.spynumbers.com/numbersDB/dbOnAirNow.php3" target="_blank">broadcasting now</a>. An incredible resource for someone starting on a quest to hear a live Numbers Station broadcast. (See also <a href="http://www.spynumbers.com/numbersDB/dbOnAirNextHour.php3" target="_blank">what may be broadcasting in the next hour</a>.) The database is publicly available, and <a title="Search the Numbers Stations database" href="http://www.spynumbers.com/numbersDB/dbSearchEntry.php3" target="_blank">searchable</a>.

<h2><a href="blog/v-is-for-victory.html">V is for Victory</a></h2>
<p>V</p>
<p>&hellip; -</p>
<p>bum-bum-bum-buuuum</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take much to unite the citizens of allied nations against the Nazi&rsquo;s, just one letter or four simple notations. Those familiar with <a title="Beethoven&apos;s 5th." target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhcR1ZS2hVo&eurl=http://blog.clandestine-movie.com/">Beethoven&rsquo;s 5th Symphony</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looney_Tunes" target="_blank">Looney Tunes</a> know it by heart. Three short notes followed by one long. Likewise, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code" target="_blank">Morse Code</a>, three dots followed by one dash represents the letter V.</p>
<p>An article by <a title="V for Victory" target="_blank" href="http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/the-v-sign/biography/v-for-victory">icons.org</a> sums it up best, but essentially by throwing up a V sign, painting a V, honking a V, or clapping a V to children, was a protest used in Nazi occupied territories during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" target="_blank">WWII</a>. The idea was attributed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_de_Laveleye" target="_blank">Victor de Laveleye</a> who might have had his own interests in promoting the letter, nevertheless his message was broadcast over the <a href="http://mt-shortwave.blogspot.com/2008/10/bbc-launches-world-news-bulletins-on.html" target="_blank">BBC network</a> on January 14th 1941 via shortwave radio.</p>
<p>Music has also played a part in the history of shortwave radios, espionage and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_station" target="_blank">Numbers Stations</a>. Many of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_station" target="_blank">Numbers Stations</a> broadcasts begin with a few bars of a familiar melody. Usually a <a title="Swedish Rhapsody" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Rhapsody" target="_blank">nationalistic folk tune</a>. Speculation suggests that this would alert the spy to the incoming message, and to ready themselves to take down the incoming code. <a href="index.html" target="_blank">Clandestine</a> documents this by using these melodies as source music through much of the <a href="index.html" target="_blank">documentary</a> and narrative parts of the film.</p>

<div id='synopsis'>
<p>Governments around the world broadcast encrypted messages via shortwave radio to secret agents in enemy territory. These publicly accessible yet indecipherable messages provide the framework for two stories, intertwining fact with fiction.</p>
<p>Clandestine documents the history of the spies caught possessing these coded messages. Juxtaposed with the stories of their capture is the fictional tale of a man’s relationship with his father, a shortwave hobbyist, and his legacy of familial secrets.</p>
<p>Using freely available archive material, the film seamlessly re-contextualizes ephemeral cinema into a story of espionage and adultery, communication and miscommunication, and the relativity of good and bad.</p>
