<h2><a href="blog/review-shorts-program-3-docunation-a-small-mention.html">REVIEW: Shorts Program 3, Docunation; A Small Mention</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://cqcentral.com/?p=1204" target="_blank">visit link &raquo;</a></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://cqcentral.com/?author=14">Cynthia Corral</a>, hardcore Cinequester and tireless reviewer gave <i><a href="http://www.clandestine-movie.com/" target="_blank">Clandestine</a></i> a brief mention in her <a target="_blank" href="http://cqcentral.com/?p=1204">review</a> of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cinequest.org/event_view.php?eid=1453">Shorts Program 3, Docunation</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span><b>CLANDESTINE</b> is a narrative about the filmmaker&rsquo;s father who is a shortwave hobbyist, but intertwined with a documentary about the encrypted messages used by spies, and the history of what happened to some of these spies.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a 30 minute film and I found it to be fascinating and well told.&nbsp; I like when documentaries teach us something, and this doc was quite interesting.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>More than thankful for this review, we are especially grateful for Cynthia&rsquo;s energy and <a title="Read about the most active Cinequester" target="_blank" href="http://www.starksilvercreek.com/2010/03/cinequest-film-festival-its-a-wrap.html">dedication</a> to Cinequest and independent film. Throughout the duration of Cinequest she watched 26 films in 11 days, and <a target="_blank" href="http://cqcentral.com/?author=14">reviewed</a> nearly all of them. She, perhaps unknowingly, was our eyes and ears to the festival. </span></p>
<p><span>As you may know, Gideon and I were unable to attend, but Cynthia was kind enough to answer some questions about our second screening.&nbsp;<span>Nearly 100 people attended Shorts Program 3 on Saturday, March 6th. The favorites among audience members were <i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.idfa.nl/industry/Festival/films-2009/film.aspx?id=b0e92826-8203-4063-b72f-59a73a978630">Notes On The Other</a></i> (which we screened with at IDFA)<i> </i>and <i>How Green Was Our Valley</i>; Cynthia mentioned Clandestine was one of her favorites as well.</span></span></p>

<p><a href="http://www.metroactive.com/moviesandtvblog/?p=5261" target="_blank">visit link &raquo;</a></p><p>A few hours before the American premiere of <a href="http://www.clandestine-movie.com/" target="_blank">Clandestine</a>, a reviewer for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.metroactive.com/">Metroactive</a>,&nbsp;Richard von Busack,&nbsp;posted a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.metroactive.com/moviesandtvblog/?p=5261">little blurb</a> about the film:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><i>Clandestine</i> by Gideon Kennedy and Marcus Rosentrater is a fascinating Jay Rosenblatt-style trip down memory lane with help from the Prelinger and other archives. The mystery of sinister &ldquo;number talkers&rdquo; is used to contrast the secrets of the narrator&rsquo;s father: he was another one of those 1950s men much better at dealing with a ham radio than with people in the room. Still: &ldquo;My father was not, as they say, a member of the second oldest profession&rdquo;&mdash;that is, a spy.</p>
<p>The directors have a big idea here: the way a covert life matches the mystery of the strange numerical codes bounced off the ionosphere by short-wave radios; in short, the father is a code that can&rsquo;t be broken. There&rsquo;s a trend in autobiographical indie film, in which it&rsquo;s explained that a parent&rsquo;s divorce is obviously the most terrible thing that ever happened in the filmmaker&rsquo;s life. I don&rsquo;t at all want to dismiss&nbsp;<i>Clandestine </i>as such, yet I can&rsquo;t buy its equation that betraying a marriage is the same thing as betraying a country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with </span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jayrosenblattfilms.com/index.php">Jay Rosenblatt&rsquo;s work</a><span>, this is a compliment.</span></p>

<p><a href="http://radio.ponik.net/index.php?text=49-clandestine-movie" target="_blank">visit link &raquo;</a></p><p>It was pleasing to find <a title="Clandestine World Premiere" target="_blank" href="http://radio.ponik.net/index.php?text=49-clandestine-movie">this post on <i>Clandestine</i></a> last week by a kind stranger abroad. Tomas Goesl is a Shortwave listener and Ham Radio operator (call OK1JRA), who keeps up a <a title="Surfing on the Radio Waves" target="_blank" href="http://radio.ponik.net/">website</a> about radios and communication across the globe. It is very thorough and up to date from what I can tell (it is in the Czech language). For any reader of the <a href="http://www.clandestine-movie.com/blog" target="_blank">Clandestine blog</a> who is interested in the topic of shortwave, radio, and Numbers Stations, it is a good place to <a target="_blank" href="http://radio.ponik.net/rss.php">subscribe</a>.</p>
<p>Contact has been established with Mr. Goesl through his website, and he has expressed more interest in viewing <a href="http://www.clandestine-movie.com" target="_blank"><i>Clandestine</i></a>. One possibility for this would be the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kviff.com/en/">44th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival</a> which takes place in July 2010.</p>
<p>So, keep your fingers crossed and tune your dials to <a target="_blank" href="http://radio.ponik.net">Surfing on the Radio Waves</a>.</p>
<p><i>Note: you can use <a title="Surfing on the Radio Waves in English" target="_blank" href="http://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=1&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fradio.ponik.net%2F&sl=cs&tl=en">Google Translate</a> to translate and browse sites in foreign languages.</i></p>
<p>Here is the Mr. Goesl&rsquo;s post translated by Google:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In its surfing the net I came across an interesting film. It&rsquo;s such a cross between a fancy story and document the numbers stations. Film-makers have used freely available documents and information tehta stations, add the story and created a piece that would have fans tehta mysterious stations certainly not be missed. The film lasts about 34 minutes, the black and white and will have its world premiere Dec. 20 at the Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival.</p>

<h2><a href="blog/america-will-see-clandestine-in-february-3-new-festivals.html">America Will See Clandestine in February, 3 New Festivals</a></h2>
<p>ATENCI&Oacute;N!</p>
<p>Since our world premiere at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam in November, we&rsquo;ve been maintaining radio silence. There were certain events that required celebration, and we took advantage of this time to suspend <i>Clandestine</i> activity. But this time away from the editing room has not been completely idle. Gideon and I have been following up with our new friends and operatives, working on publicity, and fielding submission invitations from festivals around the world. To date, <i>Clandestine</i> has been solicited by almost a dozen festivals from three different continents. While we have been greatly encouraged by the interest, we&rsquo;ve been anxious knowing that the first couple of weeks of 2010 would bring official selection notices for a handful of screening opportunities. We are proud to announce that we have been accepted to three American festivals for the month of February.</p>
<p><b>Thin Line Film Festival - 3rd Year - Denton, TX</b><br/>It is not typical for films to hold their country premieres at newer, smaller festivals. But the Thin Line Film Festival presents an environment tailored to <i>Clandestine</i>. The focus on the festival is to present films that blur the thin line between fact and fiction, documentary and narrative; films just like <i>Clandestine</i>. And so it is that <i>Clandestine</i> will hold it&rsquo;s Texas Premiere at the 3rd annual Thin Line Film Festival.</p>
<p><b>Black Maria Film + Video Festival - 29th Year - Nationwide</b><br/>The Black Maria Film + Video Festival is a touring festival. Once the films are selected by a jury, they are taken to over 65 venues across the United States from February until June. This will give <i>Clandestine</i> the opportunity to play in museums, colleges, libraries, and select theaters nationwide. Some notable past venues of the festival are the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Smithsonian in Washington DC, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and Atlanta&rsquo;s own Cinefest Theater. Black Maria focuses on short works that reveal an inventive, insightful, and uncommon spirit.</p>
<p><b>Cinequest Film Festival - 20th Year - San Jose, CA</b><br/>Being the first major independent film festival to be held after the Academy Awards, Cinequest is a festival and institution that focuses on &ldquo;The Maverick&rdquo;. It serves to highlight filmmakers who are doing what others aren&rsquo;t, who are breaking ground, and doing it with little resources. It is a terrific atmosphere for <i>Clandestine</i> to shine. We hope to see a good crowd come out to see our American Premiere at Cinequest.</p>
<p>The broadcast is in, and the message is clear. Festivals are viewing Clandestine as a fresh, inventive film, worth showcasing to a larger American audience. We are now at the true beginning of our festival tour. The next few months will bring nearly 15 more official selection notices. Expect regular contact. So keep your dials tuned here, or be left in the cold.<br/><br/> End transmission.</p>

<div id='synopsis'>
<p>Governments around the world broadcast encrypted messages via shortwave radio to secret agents in enemy territory. These publicly accessible yet indecipherable messages provide the framework for two stories, intertwining fact with fiction.</p>
<p>Clandestine documents the history of the spies caught possessing these coded messages. Juxtaposed with the stories of their capture is the fictional tale of a man’s relationship with his father, a shortwave hobbyist, and his legacy of familial secrets.</p>
<p>Using freely available archive material, the film seamlessly re-contextualizes ephemeral cinema into a story of espionage and adultery, communication and miscommunication, and the relativity of good and bad.</p>
